# Side Project Remaining Risks and Operation Guide: Coexistence of Opportunity and Threat

While the critical points raised in the side project environment may still be valid, `claude-vibe-flow` already includes **powerful defense mechanisms** within itself to mitigate these risks. This report provides a balanced analysis of the risks and their systemic solutions.

## 1. Operational Efficiency: "Paradox of Maintenance" vs "Fast-track Logic"

*   **Risk**: You might lose interest by spending time resolving conflicts between 15 agents or synchronizing settings. (Severity: High)
*   **Systemic Solution**: `pm-orchestrator` has a **'Fast-track'** function that skips all complex stages and moves immediately to the implementation stage if the request is clear and simple.
*   **Operation Tip**: If the AI asks too many questions, you can bypass the system's defensive attitude by commanding "just implement it."

## 2. Quality Control: "Limitations of Self-Critique" vs "Pattern Compliance and Minimal Change"

*   **Risk**: In a solo development situation without peers, you might miss terminal bugs by blindly trusting the AI's verification results. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Systemic Solution**: `vibe-implementer` does not write code arbitrarily, but **"complies 100% with existing code patterns"** and **"modifies only necessary parts minimally."** This design focuses on 'safe expansion' rather than creative error.
*   **Operation Tip**: After implementing core logic, don't just look at whether the unit tests generated by the agent 'succeeded,' but reconfirm the AI's intent by asking **'what the test is verifying.'**

## 3. Appropriateness of Design: "Over-Engineering" vs "No-Refactoring Principle"

*   **Risk**: Agents might suggest too heavy a structure for side projects by following formal standards. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Systemic Solution**: The implementation agent rules state **"no refactoring outside of the request"** and **"exclusion of unnecessary abstraction."** The AI is already programmed to maintain the virtue of side projects: 'simplicity.'
*   **Operation Tip**: If `architect` suggests a design that's too complex, modify the guide to say "keep it simple" or "at the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) level."

## 4. Protection of Creativity: "Socratic Dialogue" vs "Expert Summoning System"

*   **Risk**: The joy of developing vague ideas might be blocked by the AI's barrage of questions. (Severity: High)
*   **Systemic Solution**: The system is not forcing a conversation, but is a **'safety device'** that operates only when the user's intent is unclear. Once the intent is clarified, the agents immediately switch to 'practical support mode.'

## Summary: Final Checklist for Side Project Creators

| Risk Factor | Systemic Defense Mechanism | Creator's Code of Conduct |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Management Fatigue** | Fast-track routing | Shorten the process with clear requests |
| **Blind Trust in Quality** | Existing pattern replication and minimal change | Direct review of core test scenarios |
| **Over-Engineering** | No-refactoring and no-abstraction rules | Demand simplicity from an MVP perspective |
| **Break in Flow** | Intent-based selective summoning | Utilize agents when ideas are concrete |
